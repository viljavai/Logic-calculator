## Program structure
The program consists of functions for:
- parsing the inputted expression into postfix (shunting_yard)
- creating a truth table from the postfix notation (evaluate for the logical steps, create_truth_table for
constructing the table and cosmetics)
- creating the CNF- and DNF-forms from the truth table (create_cnf, create_dnf).
