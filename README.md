The program is a calculator that utilizes the Shunting Yard algorithm. It can be used to create a truth table for a propositional logic formula or convert the formula to either Disjunctive Normal Form [DNF-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form) or [CNF form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form).  A propositional formula in DNF consists of disjunctions of conjunctions, while CNF consists of conjunctions of disjunctions. Particularly, CNF is useful in automated proof systems, such as [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)). CNF and DNF forms for any formula can be directly derived from the truth table of the formula.
